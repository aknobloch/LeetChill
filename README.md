# LeetChill
Created: February 2017

Available on the [Firefox addons store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leetchill/).

LeetChill is a WebExtension that hides the difficulty levels and acceptance rates on LeetCode. The purpose of this is to avoid getting psyched out by problems that have a difficult rating. I aimed at integrating the changes seemlessly in with the page, to make it feel as if it was *meant* to be there. There is a similar extension [here](https://github.com/Nevvea7/eyepatch/tree/master), but unfortunately it was only available for Chrome. Additionally, it would have been possible to create an AdBlock filter to blank this out, but I wanted to explore the area of writing browser extensions and this seemed like a relatively simple way to get my feet wet.
