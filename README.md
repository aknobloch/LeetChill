# LeetChill
Created: February 2017

LeetChill is a WebExtension that hides the difficulty levels and acceptance rates on LeetCode. All too often I see a problem marked as difficult and feel like it psyched me out a bit. There is a similar extension [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49ddzk/chrome_extension_for_hiding_away_leetcodes/), but unfortunately it was only available for Chrome. Additionally, it would have been possible to create an AdBlock filter to blank this out, but I wanted to explore the area of writing browser extensions and this seemed like a relatively simply way to get my feet wet.
